In this paper, a simple but effective methodology is proposed for 
human activity recognition. Major focus of the work is on the design 
of descriptor for the video sequence. Frames are first represented 
by commonly used histogram of oriented gradients and histogram of 
flows. Using these histograms, a semidetailed frame level descriptor 
is formed. It is further augmented by incorporating contextual 
information. Frame level descriptors are then summarized to obtain 
the sequence level features that are utilized in activity recognition. 
SVM classifier is used for recognition. Proposed methodology is simple 
enough and free from any tracking and intensive details. Experiment is 
done on the KTH dataset. Performance of the proposed descriptors and 
their combinations are studied. Result indicates the potential of 
proposed features along with the contextual information. Comparison 
with a number of existing systems show that the performance of the 
proposed methodology is comparable.
