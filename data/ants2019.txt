Recently, deep learning for physical layer has been
modeled using autoencoders to model the entire communication
system end-to-end. We extend these methods to improve the
overall performance by adopting various learning strategies when
multiple users try to communicate over a shared channel. We
consider cooperative and non-cooperative schemes in the 2-user
Gaussian interference channel. Additionally, a simple neural
network architecture is provided for wireless communication
systems where channel gain matrix either attenuates or, in
some cases, results in fading of the message signal sent by the
transmitter.
