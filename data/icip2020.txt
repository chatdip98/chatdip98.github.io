Person re-identification in the wild needs to simultaneously 
(frame-wise) detect and re-identify persons and has wide
utility in practical scenarios. However, such tasks come
with an additional open-set re-ID challenge as all probe
persons may not necessarily be present in the (frame-wise)
dynamic gallery. Traditional or close-set re-ID systems are
not equipped to handle such cases and raise several false alarms 
as a result. To cope with such challenges open-set metric learning 
(OSML), based on the concept of Large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) 
approach, is proposed. We term our method Open-Set LMNN (OS-LMNN). 
The goal of separating impostor samples from the genuine samples
is achieved through a joint optimization of the Weibull distribution 
and the Mahalanobis metric learned through this OS-LMNN approach. 
The rejection is performed based on low probability over distance 
of imposter pairs. Exhaustive experiments with other metric learning 
techniques over the publicly available PRW dataset clearly demonstrate 
the robustness of our approach.
